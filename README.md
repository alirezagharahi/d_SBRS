# Diversification in Session-based News Recommender Systems

This page contains support material for the paper: A Gharahighehi and C Vens. “Diversification in Session-based News Recommender Systems”, under review in Personal and Ubiquitous Computing.

This research is built on implementation by [Malte Ludewig and Dietmar Jannach](https://rn5l.github.io/session-rec/index.html) [1]. In this paper we make rule-based and neighborhood based session-based recommenders, diversity-aware using news article embeddings.

Four datasets are used in this study:

- Adressa [2]: You can download the dataset from this [link](http://reclab.idi.ntnu.no/dataset/).
- Globo.com [3]: You can download the dataset from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/gspmoreira/news-portal-user-interactions-by-globocom).
- Kwestie
- Roularta

The diversification approach can be set in the [main.py](https://github.com/alirezagharahi/d_SBRS/blob/main/main.py) file. For instance "D" refers to divers neighbor/rule approach.
